Recurve Builder
*************************************************
*************************************************
The idea of this project is inspired by my friend and my personal experience. As recurve shooter, we need to build our bow accordingly and personally, and besdie of the technocial performance,
we also focus on the apperance of the setup. There are diverse colors and shapes from different manufactors, however, the seemly bow build app is missing on the market. Therefore, I choose to work
on this project and provide a high quality and free source for recurve archers to pick their equipments explictly. 

Currently I havea limited count of risers, limbs, stabilizers, sights, plungers from the main brands, including Hoyt, Wiawis, Mk, Axcel, Shibuya, Easton, etc. All the models are built by myself with 
reference from online open sources, and I will continuously increase the amount of the equipment database to provide more choice for archers.

Currently this app is under test on PC, because of the performance requirement of UE5, and will extend to Android soonly. 
The download link will be posted here, and please feel free to contact me my via email: yulingl@gwu.edu if there are any suggestion or bug to report.
